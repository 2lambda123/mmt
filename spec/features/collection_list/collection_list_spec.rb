# MMT-113

# In the future we need to add tests for 0 collections, 1 collection and multiple pages of collections.
# When we have more realistic data we also need to add tests for various counts of granules, and the proper formatting of those counts.

# NOTE: Tests for this feature are now located in the public_holdings_spec.rb file
